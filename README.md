## 🎯 What is CamBro?

**CamBro** is a two-layered student productivity platform designed to organize, simplify, and beautify your college experience.

> ✨ “Design out the struggle.” ✨

College students juggle assignments, classes, buses, library dues, events, and more—all across disconnected apps, PDFs, and WhatsApp groups. **CamBro fixes that** by bringing everything into one intelligent, aesthetic, and responsive app.
